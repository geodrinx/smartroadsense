Abstract:
Monitoring of road surface conditions is a critical activity in transport 
infrastructure management. Many research solutions have been proposed in order 
to automatically control and check the quality of road surfaces. Most of them 
make use of expensive sensors embedded in vehicles or mainly focus on detection 
of specific anomalies during monitoring activity.In this paper, we describe the 
design of a system for collaborative monitoring of road surface quality. The 
overall architecture encompasses the integration of a custom mobile application, 
a georeferenced database system and a visualization front-end. Road surface 
condition is summarized through a roughness parameter computed using signal 
processing algorithms running on mobile devices. The roughness values computed 
are subsequently transmitted and stored into a back-end geographic information 
system enabling processing of aggregated traces and visualization of road 
conditions. The proposed approach introduces a thoroughly integrated system 
suitable for monitoring applications in a scalable, crowdsourcing collaborative 
setting.
